What is Photonic Bitcoin (pBTC)?
-------------------------------

Photonic Bitcoin is a fork of Bitcoin and Optical Bitcoin aiming to reduce mining energy consumption via compatability with cutting edge optical compute cores.  Like
Bitcoin, Photonic Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments
to anyone, anywhere in the world. Photonic Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to
operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are
carried out collectively by the network. Photonic Bitcoin Core is the name of open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

Instead of using the traditional Bitcoin difficulty, pBTC will recalculate difficulty every 60 blocks. This will avoid the network being stuck.

Photnic Bitcoin can currently be mined using CPU’s and GPU’s. In the future it will be mined by low powered technology efficient optical computing developed by PoWx.

Photonic Bitcoin makes use of Heavyhash, an algortihm developed by PoWx to reduce the electricty usage of modern day mining.

information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, and it is aimed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/PhotonicBitcoin/pBTC-core/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Photonic Bitcoin (pBTC) Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.


Contributors
------------

The project would be impossible without the Bitcoin Core. We thank the Bitcoin
Core contributors for their effort.
